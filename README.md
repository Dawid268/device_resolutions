# Device Resolutions

I haven't been able to find a good programmatically accessible list of devices and resolutions, so I'm compiling one. Contributions welcome.

`device_resolutions.csv` contains entries for device, HW resolution, SW resolution, PPI, primary orientation and can be used to derive screen dimensions and aspect ratio.
